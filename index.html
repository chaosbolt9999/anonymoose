<div class="content">
  <div class="about">   Data privacy, in simple terms, is the term referring to the protection of your own data. When you lend your personal information to a company or corporation, these companies 
"promise" to keep your data safe, and to only use the data for the purposes you have agreed to.
The catch is that important information about these purposes can only be found in an extremely boring, hard-to-read wall of text called the Privacy Policy. Many people skip the privacy policy due to this reason, and therefore unknowingly agree to a bunch of really scary stuff.

<div class="privacytitle"> What is the Data Privacy Act (in the Philippines)?</div>
<div class="privacyact"> Republic Act 10173, or the Data Privacy Act of 2012, was enacted to protect and guard personal information, whether this be in print or in digital form. To help in achieving this, the act also creates the National Privacy Commission, a group formed to help implement the laws introduced by the act.
The act provides penalties for the unlawful accessing, processing, disclosure, or disposal of personal and sensitive information, ranging from fines of one hundred thousand pesos and one year imprisonment to fines of five million pesos and six years imprisonment. <br><br>
The National Privacy Commission has its own <a href="https://privacy.gov.ph">website</a>. In the website, you can find a full copy of the Data Privacy act, a short, summarized version of it, a few statistics relating to data privacy in the Philippines, and a few tips and tricks to keep your data private.</div>
