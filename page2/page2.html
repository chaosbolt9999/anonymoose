    <div class="mainimg"><img src="../images/identity theft.png" class="bigimg"></div>
    <div class="maintxt">When you sign up for an account on a social media site, the site usually asks you for some information about yourself, such as your full name, your gender, your birthdate, and sometimes your place of residence. Keeping this data private is vital - as there are many ways other people can access this data.
        <br><br>
 
If someone gets ahold of your personal information, you could be subject to identity theft. Identity theft is an act where someone masquerades as you, even though they’re not you. Additionally, some pieces of information (such as bank details, addresses and social security numbers) are very sensitive - and if someone accesses these pieces of information, they could potentially do very bad things to your accounts and credentials.
